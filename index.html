    <p>Hello! My name is Joyce Achen, and I'm thrilled to be from Uganda, a country with a rich culture 
      and growing tech landscape. As a passionate web developer, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to 
      learn and grow in this dynamic field. I enjoy exploring new technologies, frameworks, and 
      tools that enable me to build innovative and user-friendly web applications. My ultimate career goal is to become 
      a full-stack developer, where I can leverage my skills in both front-end and back-end development to 
      create seamless and engaging digital experiences. I'm excited about the prospect of working on projects that 
      challenge me and push the boundaries of what's possible in web development.</p>
